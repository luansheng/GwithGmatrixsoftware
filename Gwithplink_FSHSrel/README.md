### Compute G using PLINK v1.9  

Genomic relationships will be computed with Yang et al 2010 implemented in PLINK v1.9

After computing the G matrix, additonal R functions are available to plot out fimilial relationships (i.e. Full-sib and Half-sib relationships)  

The script for making these plt are ported from https://github.com/soloboan/Fullsib_relationships.  

Read that page for description of the function.



##### This is how to run the script for computing G with PLINK and ploting out the relationships
